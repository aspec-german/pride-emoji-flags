# pride-emoji-flags

![Pride Emoji Flags][banner]

This is a fork of [joypixels/pride-emoji-flags][upstream] by
[JoyPixels][JoyPixels] to provide a fully-inclusive set
of pride emoji flags.

## what's included?

Hopefully all flags in SVG and PNG (512px) format within the repository.  
If something is missing, please tell us :blush:

## how can I use them?

These flags have not been [recommended for general interchange (RGI) by
Unicode][rgi], meaning there is no globally shared emoji code point by
which they can be referred. [A petition][petition] exists to help drive
the movement for inclusion into Unicode.

These flags are released under the Creative Commons
[(CC-BY-4.0)][cc-by-4.0] license so that there are few limits
on the ways they can be used. Websites, apps, sticker packs, and
physical goods (stickers, posters, etc) are all permitted within the
CC-BY-4.0 license. Please see this guide on [best practices for
attribution][attribution].

## can I contribute?

We gladly accept design suggestions and bug fixes! If you see an issue
with any of the artwork please [submit an issue][issue] and let us
know what needs fixed up. You may also submit a pull request that
includes the fixes. Keep in mind that to maintain the image quality it
is best to modify the SVG file and submit updates that way.

## thank you

And thanks to [Fullscreen Inc][fullscreen] for the inspiration and
guidance.
